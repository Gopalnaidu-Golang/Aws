What's an Auto scaling group?
in real life the load on your websites and application can change.
in the cloud you can create and get rid of servers very quickly

The goal of Auto Scaling group:
1. scale out add instances
2. scale in remove instances
3. Ensure we have min and max num of machines are running
4. Automatically register new instances to a load balencer.

web traffic->Loadbalencer -> instances.

ASG have the following attributes:

AMI-instances
EC2 user-data
EBS volumes
security groups
ssh key pair
min/max/initial capacity
network/subnet information
Load balencer information
Scaling polices.

How to create auto scaling group:
First Create launch configuration(new EC2 with security grp) then allows to create ASG.
create asg:
grp size, net work and advance datails having load balence, target grp,health check
scaling policy,
configure notifications,tags,review

Auto scaling alarms:
It is a possible to scale ASG based on cloud watch alarms
An alarm moniters a metrics[avg cpu]
Get started and create cpu alarm for ASG
then trigger alarms
Observe if our app scales using a chrome extension

Mangament->cloud watch->alarms to see alarms which are created.
