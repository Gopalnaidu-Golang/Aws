EC2: capabilties are in AWS CONSOLE.
  Renting virtual machine : start/stop/terminate.
  Storage data on virtual drives EBS
  Distributing load across machine ELB
  Scaling the service using an auto scaling group ASG
  
  1.coose region on right side of console
  2.Launch instance
    1. choose an amazon machine image AMI
    2. choose an instance type means size of instance
    3.configure instance
    4. add storage
    5. add tags
    6. configure security group
    7. regview and launch->select existing key or create new key pair->Download key pair in form of xx.pem file
    
    How to stop instance: go to action option with right click then stop.
    How to access instance using linux: using ssh : SSH runs on port 22 and controle a remote machine using command line
      command1: ssh ec2-username@DNS_url. then will get permission denied then use xxx.pem file
      command2: ssh -i ./xxx.pem ec2-username@DNS_url. then will get bad permission then give permission 
      command3: chmod xxx.pem then run command2.
      command4: whoami and ping google.com. then exit instance
      vi ~/.ssh/config
      content: 
      Host my-first-machine
           Hostname DNS_Url
           User ec2-user
           IdentityFile ~/ec2-masterclass/ec2-masterclass.pem
           
      How to access instance very fast: then setup ssh/config file like above
      command: ssh my-first-machine then automaticlaly login instance
      
   How to access instance using windows:  download putty -> open putty 
     use public DNS url or public Ip as hostname using username@Public IP
     setup xxx.pem file from SSH option in putty but xx.pem file not acceptable so convert as xxx.ppk file using puttygen then load the ppk file
     then check security group option in ec2 instance to have all permissions to access through windows.
     then click on Open option in putty to connct instance then able to login successfully.
   
  SECURITY GROUP: inbound and out bound traffic
  security group -> click myinstance -> create security grp/remove security grp -> EDIT inbound rule
  if remv grp then when access instance using SSH will get timed out
  
  PRIVATE and PUBLIC IP: 
  iPV4: [0-255][0-255][0-255][0-255]
  IPV6 is newer and solves problems for internet of things IOT
  private network IP are may be same but not public networks IP should Uniq.
  Prive networks comminicate with public networks using internet gateway [proxy]
  
  PRIVATE IP: 
  Machine can identiey only in private network
  IP must be uniq across private Network
  But 2 different private network IP can have the same IP's
  only specified range of IP's are can be used as private network
  
  
 when machine stop and start or restart instance then always change public IP address and if use privste IP it wont work.
 Bootstrapping means launching commans when a machine starts using ec2 user data scripts.
 while lauching instance -> configure instancs -> advanced option: better to create separate security group to connect machine .
 Ex: install httpd:
 #!bin/bash
 yum update -y 
 yum instsll -y httpd
 service httpd start
 chkconfig httpd on
 
   EC2 PRICING:per second minimum of 60 seconds or per hour.
   If stop the instance no cost chargable.
      
   EC2 running modes:
   1. Reserved instances
   2.spot instances
   3. Dedicated instances
